## ❓ Problem Statement  
Mental health issues are rising due to modern lifestyle changes, work pressure, lack of sleep, excessive social media usage, and more. However, there is limited awareness of how these individual factors contribute to stress or severity in mental health conditions.

## 🎯 Goals
- Identify correlations between mental health and factors like sleep hours, work hours, physical activity, and social media usage
- Provide an easy-to-understand dashboard for non-technical users
- Enable filtering and slicing to support deeper personalized exploration
- Help users recognize risk patterns and encourage healthy lifestyle decisions
